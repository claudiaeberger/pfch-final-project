# pfch-final-project
This is the repository for my project: Understanding the Plants of Central Park created for the Spring 2021 [Programming for Cultural Heritage](http://pfch.nyc/) course at Pratt Institute. It uses data from Central Park Conservancy, the Audubon Society, the Native American Ethnobotany Database, the New York Floral Atlas, and the Welikia Project to tell a fuller story about the history and uses of the plants in Central Park.

It was constructed primarily using Python and ArcGIS. In Python BeautifulSoup was used to collect data when a download wasn't available, and Pandas to combine all of the datasets. The data was then mapped in ArcGIS and published using ArcGIS's Experience Builder, which allowed the project to be published on a mobile friendly micro-site. This means users can access the maps easily from their phones when they are in Central Park to understand the plants in their area. 

All of the code and data are available in this repository. But if you have any questions please do not hesitate to [contect me](mailto:claudiaeberger@gmail.com).
